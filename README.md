# aider-acp

This repository is the actively maintained fork of the Aider ACP bridge, focused on staying aligned with the latest ACP session update semantics (plans, tool calls, and mode updates).

An [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://zed.dev/blog/bring-your-own-agent-to-zed) bridge that integrates [Aider](https://aider.chat) into editors like [Zed](https://zed.dev).
This project allows you to use Aider as an AI coding assistant inside Zed, review diffs, and apply changes seamlessly.

---

## 🚀 Overview

- **Runs as a standalone ACP agent**: Zed spawns this project as an external process.
- **Communicates with Zed via ACP (JSON-RPC over stdio)**.
- **Communicates with Aider via subprocess**: calls the `aider` CLI binary under the hood.
- **Diff workflow**:
  1. Zed sends a prompt via ACP.
  2. This bridge launches Aider with the request.
  3. Aider applies edits directly to disk.
  4. Changes are returned in SEARCH/REPLACE code block.
  5. Zed shows the changes (unformatted!!)

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Node.js** 20+
- **TypeScript** (installed as dev dependency)
- **Aider** (Python package) installed globally or in your environment:

  ```bash
  pip install aider-chat
  ```

- **Git** (Aider expects a git repo to track changes)
- **Zed Editor** or other editor with ACP support (v0.201.5+)

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone and setup the project

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd aider-acp
# Install dependencies (use npm if you don't have pnpm)
pnpm install  # or npm install

# Compile the TypeScript sources
pnpm run build  # or npm run build
```

For a fast smoke test without Zed, you can run the parser test harness:

```bash
npm run build
node dist/index.js --test-parser
```

### 2. Test the agent standalone

```bash
# Test the ACP agent directly
node test-acp.js
```

### 3. Configure in Zed

Add this configuration to your Zed settings (`cmd/ctrl + ,` → Open `settings.json`):

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Aider": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/your/aider-acp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Important**: Replace `/absolute/path/to/your/aider-acp/` with the actual absolute path to your cloned project.

### 4. Use in Zed

1. Open the Agent Panel: `cmd/ctrl + ?`
2. Click the `+` button in the top right
3. Select "Aider" from the dropdown
4. Start chatting with Aider directly in Zed!

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```
You: "Add error handling to the main function in src/index.ts"
Aider: *analyzes code and applies changes*
Zed: *shows real-time diff updates*
```

### With File Context
```
You: "Refactor this function to use async/await"
*Select code in editor before sending*
Aider: *receives context and makes improvements*
```

## 🛠 How it Works

### ACP Protocol Flow
1. **Initialization**: Zed sends `initialize` → Agent responds with capabilities
2. **Session Creation**: Zed sends `session/new` → Agent creates session context and announces the current mode
3. **Prompt Processing**: Zed sends `session/prompt` → Agent processes with Aider
4. **Real-time Updates**: Agent sends structured `session/update` notifications (plans, tool calls for edits, mode updates, and message chunks) during execution
5. **Completion**: Agent responds with `stopReason: "end_turn"`

### Technical Implementation
- **JSON-RPC 2.0** communication over stdin/stdout
- **Subprocess execution** of Aider CLI with proper argument handling
- **Git diff parsing** to capture and report changes
- **Streaming updates** for real-time progress feedback
- **Error handling** with proper ACP error codes

---

## 🐛 Debugging

### View ACP Communication Logs in Zed
1. Open Command Palette (`cmd/ctrl + shift + p`)
2. Run `dev: open acp logs`
3. This opens a dedicated panel showing all JSON-RPC messages between Zed and the agent in real-time
4. You'll see the complete protocol flow: initialize, session/new, session/prompt, session/update, etc.

## ✅ Current Status

- ✅ **Basic ACP loop** (initialize + session management + prompt and response)
- ✅ **Aider subprocess integration** with proper argument handling and file editing
- ✅ **Real-time structured updates**: ACP-compliant plan updates, mode announcements, tool calls for edit diffs, and streaming message chunks
- ✅ **Confirmation prompts aligned with ACP**: permission requests include titles, option kinds, and targeted apply/skip choices per the latest SDK expectations

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- [ ] **Diff parsing to ACP edits**: Convert SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to structured file_edit blocks
- [ ] **Model selection**: UI for choosing Aider's LLM models
- [ ] **File context**: Better integration with Zed's file selection
- [ ] **Slash commands**: Implement aider slash commands for quick actions
- [ ] **ACP-aligned output formatting**: Normalize all Aider messages (user input prompts, errors, additional info) to ACP message kinds and preserve formatting
